Exemplo 2.1: EXPRESSÕES REGULARES

Excerpt from: "Julius Caesar, From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia":

"In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, an informal 
political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts 
to amass political power were opposed by many in the Senate, among them Cato the 
Younger with the private support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most 
powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories 
in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, which greatly extended Roman territory. 
During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the river Rhine.
These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the 
standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of 
Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step 
down from his military command and return to Rome. In 49 BC, Caesar openly defied 
the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the 
head of an army.[3] This began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in 
a position of near-unchallenged power and influence in 45 BC."
